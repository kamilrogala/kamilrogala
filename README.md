# Hi, I'm Kamil

**Frontend/Software Engineer | Legacy slayer | Refactor enthusiast | Tech advocate**

Frontend Developer with over a decade of experience, specializing in large-scale and wide-ranging projects. I work on solutions that reach millions of users on a daily basis, but I am equally eager to develop internal tools, automations, and improvements for editorial and development teams.

I don't limit myself to the UI layer - I create scripts, tinker with configurations, optimize performance, eliminate legacy, and automate what can be automated. I believe that a good refactor is not just a technical task, but a form of empathy for future creators.

I value meaningful technology - one that really helps people, businesses, and teams. I like it when code speeds up page loading, simplifies the work of an editor, or saves another developer time.

Because good work makes sense: technological, business, and human.
